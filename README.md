# B2500 Meter

This project replicates a Smart Meter device for a B2500 energy storage system while allowing integration with various smart meters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation:** Make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Configuration:** Create a `config.ini` file in the root directory of the project and add the appropriate configuration as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### Windows

1. **Open Command Prompt**
   - Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```cmd
   cd path\to\b2500-meter
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```cmd
   pipenv install
   ```

4. **Run the Script**
   ```cmd
   pipenv run python main.py
   ```

### macOS

1. **Open Terminal**
   - Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit Enter.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd path/to/b2500-meter
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

4. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   pipenv run python main.py
   ```

### Linux

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

2. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   pipenv run python main.py
   ```

### Additional Notes

When the script is running, switch your B2500 to "Self-Adaptation" mode to enable the powermeter functionality.

## Configuration

The configuration is managed using an `ini` file called `config.ini`. Below, you'll find the configuration settings required for each supported powermeter type.

### General Configuration

Optionally add a general section with the option to enable or disable summation of phase values.

```ini
[GENERAL]
# By default, the script will sum the power values of all phases and report them as a single value on phase 1. To disable this behavior, add the following configuration to the `config.ini` file
DISABLE_SUM_PHASES = False
# Setting this to true, disables the powermeter test at the beginning of the script.
SKIP_POWERMETER_TEST = False
# By default, the script sends an absolute value of the measured power. This seems to be necessary for the storage system, since it can't handle negative values (results in an integer overflow). Set this to true to clamp the values to 0 instead of sending the absolute value.
DISABLE_ABSOLUTE_VALUES = False
# Sets the interval at which the script sends new power values to the B2500 in seconds. The original Smart Meter sends new values every second.
POLL_INTERVAL = 1
```

PASSWORD = mqtt_pass (Optional)
```

The `JSON_PATH` option is used to extract the power value from a JSON payload. The path must be a [valid JSONPath expression](https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/). 
If the payload is a simple integer value, you can omit this option.

### Modbus

```ini

### Script

You can also use a custom script to get the power values. The script should output at most 3 integer values, separated by a line break.
```ini
[SCRIPT]
COMMAND = /path/to/your/script.sh
```

## Home Assistant Add-on Installation

You can install the B2500 Meter add-on either through the Home Assistant repository or manually.

### Option 1: Installation via Repository (Recommended)

1. **Add the Repository to Home Assistant**
   - Open your Home Assistant instance
   - Go to Settings â†’ Add-ons
   - Click the three dots menu in the top right corner
   - Select "Repositories"
   - Add the following URL: `https://github.com/tomquist/b2500-meter`
   - Click "Add"

2. **Install the Add-on**
   - Click on "Add-on Store" in the bottom right corner
   - The B2500 Meter add-on should appear in the add-on store
   - Click on it and then click "Install"

3. **Configure the Add-on**
   - After installation, go to the add-on's Configuration tab
   - Set the `Power Input Alias` and optionally the `Power Output Alias` to the entity IDs of your power sensors in Home Assistant
   - Click "Save" to apply the configuration

4. **Start the Add-on**
   - Go to the add-on's Info tab
   - Click "Start" to run the add-on

### Option 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer to install the add-on manually, you can do so using either the Samba or SSH add-ons:

#### Using Samba:
1. Enable and start the Samba add-on in Home Assistant
2. Your Home Assistant instance will appear in your local network, sharing a folder called "addons"
3. This "addons" folder is where you should store your custom add-ons

   **Tip for macOS users:** If the folder doesn't show up automatically, go to Finder, press CMD+K, and enter `smb://homeassistant.local`

#### Using SSH:
1. Install the SSH add-on in Home Assistant
2. Before starting it, you need to have a private/public key pair and store your public key in the add-on config (refer to the SSH add-on documentation for more details)
3. Once started, you can SSH into Home Assistant
4. Store your custom add-ons in the `/addons` directory

#### Installation Steps:
1. **Copy the add-on files**
   - Copy the `ha_addon` folder from this repository into the `addons` directory you accessed via Samba or SSH
   - The resulting path should look like: `/addons/ha_addon/`
   - Rename the folder to `b2500_meter`

2. **Install and run the add-on**
   - Follow steps 2-4 from the repository installation method above

## Node-RED Implementation

This project also provides a Node-RED implementation, allowing integration with various smart meters. The Node-RED flow is available in the `nodered.json` file.

### Installation and Setup

1. **Import the Node-RED Flow**
   - Open your Node-RED dashboard.
   - Navigate to the menu in the top right corner, select "Import" and then "Clipboard".
   - Copy the content of `nodered.json` and paste it into the import dialog, then click "Import".

2. **Hooking Powermeter Readings**
   - Ensure your powermeter readings are available as a Node-RED message with the power values in the payload.
   - Connect the output of your powermeter reading nodes to the input node of the subflow named "B2500". The subflow can handle:
     - An array of 3 numbers or strings containing numbers, representing the power values of each phase, e.g. `[100, 200, 300]`.
     - A single number or string containing a number, which will be interpreted as the value for the first phase, with the other two phases set to 0.
   - Ensure that a fresh powermeter reading is sent to the flow every second.

3. **Running the Flow**
   - Deploy the flow by clicking the "Deploy" button on the top right corner of the Node-RED dashboard.
   - The flow will now listen for powermeter readings and handle the UDP and TCP communications as configured.
